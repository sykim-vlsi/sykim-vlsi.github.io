I am an incoming M.S. student in **Electronic Engineering** at **Kyungpook National University (KNU)**, Korea.  
My research goal is to become a **"Semiconductor Architect"** who bridges the gap between **Device Physics** and **EDA (Electronic Design Automation)**.

I have a strong background in semiconductor device physics and fabrication, having conducted research on **2D material-based optoelectronics** and **heterogeneous integration**. Currently, I am expanding my expertise into **VLSI Physical Design**, focusing on **Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO)** and **ML-enhanced EDA algorithms**.

I aim to be an engineer who not only solves given problems but defines new ones by connecting atomic-scale physics with system-level architecture.

**"I aim to become an engineer who thinks deeply and a philosopher who builds precisely."**
