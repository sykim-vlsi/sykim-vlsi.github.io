I am an incoming M.S. student in **Electronic Engineering** at [**Kyungpook National University (KNU)**](https://en.knu.ac.kr/main/main.htm), Korea.  
My research goal is to become a **"Semiconductor Architect"** who bridges the gap between **Device Physics** and **EDA (Electronic Design Automation)**.

I have a strong background in semiconductor device physics and fabrication, having conducted research on **2D material-based optoelectronics** and **2D materials heterostructure**. Currently, I am expanding my expertise into **VLSI Physical Design**, focusing on **Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO)** and **ML-enhanced EDA algorithms**.

I aim to be an engineer who not only solves given problems but defines new ones by connecting atomic-scale physics with system-level architecture.

## 🔬 Research Interests
* **Physical Design & EDA/CAD in VLSI** (Placement)
* **Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO/STCO)**
* **High-Performance Computing for EDA** (GPU Acceleration, Heterogeneous Computing)
